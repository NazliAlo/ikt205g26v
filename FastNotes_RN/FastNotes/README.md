# Welcome to FastNotes React Native application 👋

FastNotes lets you build your own simple notes with only tilte and content. The app generates and displays createdAt date also. To create a note you can simply click on pluss button, write your title and content, then click enter. 

The application has two main screens 
1. main-screen that shows list of your notes, and let you build new once
2. noteDetailScreen that displays tilte, content and createdAt date of given screen

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

To use the last option, you need to download Expo Go application on your own mobile/device. You can then scan the QR code that appear in the log/terminal, and the Expo Go application will wrap FastNotes and run it


You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
